## 🧐 Overview

This project is a frontend application built with React and Vite. It fetches or loads user data and presents it in a table form, enabling sorting/filtering (if implemented), and provides a clean and responsive UI for viewing user details.

## ✅ Features

* Display user data in a table (name, email, role, etc.).
* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
* Clean UI built in React.
* Codebase powered by Vite for fast build times.
* Expandable to add features like pagination, filtering, editing rows, etc.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* React
* Vite
* JavaScript (or TypeScript if you used it)
* CSS / styling (plain CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components depending on your implementation)
* (Optional) any UI library or custom components

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshada9763/Assignment.git
   cd Assignment
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or whichever port Vite uses) in your browser to view the app.

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## 📁 Project Structure

Here’s a typical project structure you might have:

```
/src
  ├─ components/         # React components (Table, TableRow, etc.)
  ├─ App.jsx             # Main application component
  ├─ index.jsx           # Entry point
  ├─ styles/             # CSS files or modules
vite.config.js           # Vite configuration
package.json             # Dependencies & scripts
README.md                # This file
```

Feel free to adjust this structure to match exactly what you have.

## 🎯 Usage

* On launching the app, you should see a table listing user records.
* You can scroll through the table, sort columns (if implemented), or click on a row to view details (if such functionality exists).
* You can extend the app by:

  * Adding pagination (to handle large data sets)
  * Adding search / filter functionality
  * Allowing add / edit / delete user rows
  * Applying more advanced styling or theming

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Integrate an actual backend or API to fetch real user data.
* Use TypeScript for type safety.
* Add unit tests (e.g., with Jest + React Testing Library).
* Improve UI/UX: hover states, row selection, modal for details.
* Better state management if the app grows (e.g., Redux, Zustand).
* Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
* Make deployment ready (e.g., via Vercel, Netlify) with CI/CD.
